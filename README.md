VS-Lite Model of Tree-Ring Width

# ABSTRACT: 
We present a simple, efficient, process-based forward model 
of tree-ring growth, called Vaganov-Shashkin-Lite (VS-Lite), 
that requires as inputs only latitude and monthly temperature 
and precipitation. Simulations of six bristlecone pine ring-width 
chronologies demonstrate the interpretability of model output 
as an accurate representation of the climatic controls on growth. 
Ensemble simulations by VS-Lite of two networks of North American 
ring-width chronologies correlate with observations at higher 
significance levels on average than simulations formed by 
regression of ring width on the principal components of the 
same monthly climate data. VS-Lite retains more skill outside 
of calibration intervals than does the principal components 
regression approach. It captures the dominant low- and high 
frequency spatiotemporal ring-width signals in the network 
with an inhomogeneous, multivariate relationship to climate.  
Because continuous meteorological data are most widely available 
at monthly temporal resolution, our model extends the set 
of sites at which forward-modeling studies are possible.
